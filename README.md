# CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game
This gaming is modified by snake game source . I try to build brick game. In The Pong Tutorial, we introduced paddle movement, ball movement and simple collisions. In Breakout, there is no Artificial Intelligence. The player has to clear a board of bricks by shooting a ball against them. He controls a horizontal paddle and must prevent the ball from leaving the bottom part of the screen. When all of the bricks are removed from the board, a new level should be presented. In addition to the mechanics we implemented for Pong, a game like Breakout needs level management and more complex brick-ball collisions.
